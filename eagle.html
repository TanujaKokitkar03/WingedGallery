        <h1>Eagle</h1> <br>
        <p>Eagle, any of many large, heavy-beaked, big-footed birds of prey belonging to the family Accipitridae (order
            Accipitriformes). In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo. An eagle may resemble
            a vulture in build and flight characteristics but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet
            equipped with great curved talons. A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live
            prey. They are too ponderous for effective aerial pursuit but try to surprise and overwhelm their prey on
            the ground. Like owls, many decapitate their kills. Because of their strength, eagles have been a symbol of
            war and imperial power since Babylonian times. Their likeness is found on Greek and Roman ruins, coins, and
            medals. Eagles are monogamous. They mate for life and use the same nest each year. They tend to nest in
            inaccessible places, incubating a small clutch of eggs for six to eight weeks. The young mature slowly,
            reaching adult plumage in the third or fourth year.</p>
        <p>The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It
            is estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human.[5][6][7] This
            acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily
            attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming
            light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light.[8] The female of all
            known species of eagles is larger than the male. </p>

        <p>Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs,
            but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no
            action to stop the killing.[11][12] It is said[by whom?] that eagles fly above clouds but this is not
            true.[citation needed] Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind's pressure. This saves the bird's
            energy. Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as
            apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Icthyophaga eagles
            prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other
            water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera
            Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the
            tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats,
            taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such
            as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial
            predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in
            woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds,
            which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among
            the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their
            environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so
            the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.</p>

        <p>The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles are very common. Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.[13] Eagles in the genus Aquila, found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.</p>
