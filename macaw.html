                    <p>The blue-and-gold macaw is aptly named, with a gorgeous blue body and dark lemon-yellow chest, this is a bird that's hard to miss. It also referred to as the blue-and-yellow macaw. This macaw has a green strip of feathers just above its black beak, and a partially naked face that will blush pink when it is excited. Its feet are dark gray or black, and it has a black “beard” of feathers just below its beak. Blue-and-gold macaws are native to South and Central America, where they inhabit forests and woodlands. Their range includes Venezuela south to Peru, Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, as well as parts of Panama.</p>

                    <p>Like most macaw species, blue-and-gold macaws are typically available at avian-only retail stores, direct from a bird breeder or through a bird rescue/adoption organization. If you adopt a pet blue & gold from a bird rescue/adoption organization or from an individual, ask for the bird's complete history, including the reason why the bird is being given up for adoption, as well as its behavioral quirks.</p>

        <p>In the wild, most macaws, including blue-and-gold macaws, eat a variety of seeds, plant material, fruits, and nuts. The wild macaw's diet tends to be high in fat, which is acceptable for a bird that spends its day flying through the rainforest, finding food, nesting, and rearing chicks. Companion macaws are lucky to have a much easier life than their wild counterparts, but they miss out on the ability to forage for their food, a behavior that comes naturally. Macaws, including blue-and-gold macaws, thrive on a nutritionally balanced diet as well as fresh fruits and veggies and healthy table foods. If a blue-and-gold macaw remains healthy, it can live upwards of 70 years. This is a bird that will be with you for a lifetime, and you should prepare for this possibility, which may even include a trust or a clause in your Will dedicated to the bird. Like most macaws, the blue-and-gold macaw is capable of making loud, ear-piercing sounds and can be prone to bouts of screaming. You will not be able to hide this pet from a landlord, so understand the vocal abilities of this bird before you bring it home. There really is no way to make a screaming macaw cease and desist its vocalizations, especially around dusk, when parrots are most vocal. Blue-and-gold macaws are apt talkers, able to repeat simple words and phrases.</p>

        <p>The Blue-and-Yellow Macaw is native to South America. It can be found in a variety of habitats, from dense cloud forests to open savannas. These birds are particularly common in the Amazon Basin, where they are known for their distinctive calls and colorful plumage. One of the most important habitats for Blue-and-Yellow Macaws is the Manu National Park in Peru. This nature reserve is home to a large population of these birds. In the wild, Blue-and-Yellow Macaws are highly social creatures, often living in large flocks that can number in the hundreds. They are also incredibly intelligent, with the ability to learn and mimic a wide range of sounds, including human speech. In their natural habitat, these birds are known for their flying skills. It is common to see them soaring through the canopy and performing curious aerial displays. Blue-and-Yellow Macaws face a number of threats in the wild, including habitat loss and illegal poaching for the pet trade. Efforts to protect these birds and their habitat are crucial to ensuring their survival for generations to come.</p>
