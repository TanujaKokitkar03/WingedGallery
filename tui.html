They look black from a distance, but in good light tui have a blue, green and bronze iridescent sheen, and distinctive white throat tufts (poi). </p>

                    <p>Tui have almost-black heads, underparts, wings and tails that have an iridescent blue and green sheen, especially on the head and wings. The upper back and flanks are dark reddish brown with a bronze sheen, the nape and sides of the neck have filamentous white feathers, and there are two unusual curled white feather tufts on the throat (poi). Small white shoulder patches on the upperwing show prominently in flight, but are usually concealed when perched. The bill and feet are black, and the eye dark brown. The sexes are alike, but the male is larger. Adults have a notch on the 8th primary, and this feather quivers from the narrow part creating the whirring sound in flight. At first, juveniles have a browner body and lack the throat tuft, but after a few months they are only distinguishable in the hand from the lack of notch on the 8th primary.</p>

                    <h3>Distribution and habitat</h3>
                    <p>Tui are widespread and locally abundant on the North, South and Stewart Islands, and their offshore islands; they are scarce only in drier, largely open country east of the Southern Alps. Tui are present on the Kermadec and Auckland Islands, and there is a larger subspecies endemic to the Chatham Islands. Tui are absent on the Poor Knights Islands probably due to the very high density of bellbirds there competing for a limited nectar resource. Tui are found in native forest and scrub (sometimes in exotic forests), and in rural gardens, stands of flowering kowhai and gums, and in suburban parks and gardens. There is much local movement, when tui follow a seasonal succession of flowering or fruiting plants. They usually nest in native forest and scrub, but will commute more than 10 km daily to feed on rich sources of nectar.</p>

        <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>Tui are locally abundant on the mainland and on some offshore islands, especially where there is a concentration of flowering plants or fruiting trees (e.g. flowering kowhai, fuchsia, flax, rata or gums; or fruiting kahikatea) and generally in higher numbers in areas where there has been pest (possum and predator) control. They are common on the Kermadec and Auckland Islands, but are scarce on the main Chatham Island (they are more common in the southern Chatham Islands).</p>

        <h3>Threats and conservation</h3>
        <p>Tui were the most common passerine found in Maori middens and were probably once an important source of protein. Despite the loss of the vast majority of lowland forest in New Zealand, tui have probably benefitted from the introduction to New Zealand of a variety of flowering and fruiting plants. These new species, as well as 'out-of-range' plantings of native species and sugar-water feeders in gardens, now provide tui with a reliable year-round supply of nectar and fruit. Tui respond extremely well to pest control programmes targeting possums, rats and mustelids, which are probably their main nest predators.</p>
