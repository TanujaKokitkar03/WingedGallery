        <h1>Indian Pitta</h1> <br>

        <p>The Indian pitta is a passerine bird native to the Indian subcontinent. It inhabits scrub jungle, deciduous and dense evergreen forest. It breeds in the forests of the Himalayas, hills of central and western India, and migrates to other parts of the peninsula in winter.  Although very colourful, it is usually shy and hidden in the undergrowth where it picks insects on the forest floor. It has a distinctive two note whistling call which is heard at dawn and dusk. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List as the population is considered large. The word 'pitta' is derived from the Telugu language meaning 'small bird'. Pittas are among the few Old World suboscine birds. The Indian pitta is the basal member of a distinct clade that includes many of the Oriental species.</p>

        <p>The Indian pitta is a small stubby-tailed bird that is mostly seen on the floor of forests or under dense undergrowth, foraging on insects in leaf litter. It has long, strong legs, a very short tail and stout bill, with a buff-coloured crown stripe, black coronal stripes, a thick black eye stripe and white throat and neck. The upper parts are green, with a blue tail, the underparts buff, with bright red on the lower belly and vent. The bird hops on the ground to forage and has been known to get trapped in ground traps meant for small mammals. The Indian pitta shows local migration. From October to March, these birds largely keep to the broad-leaved deciduous or semi-deciduous forested tracts of southern India and Sri Lanka. Usually around mid-April, they begin their voyage north. At this time, they often turn up in curious places. Besides gardens and groves, young birds may accidentally bang against windowpanes or be found exhausted in housing societies. Presumably this happens due to confusion from artificial illumination as they have been known to migrate through the night.</p>

        <h3>Distribution and habitat</h3>
        <p>The Indian pitta breeds mainly in the Himalayan foothills from the Margalla hills in northern Pakistan to Nepal and possibly up to Sikkim in the east, and in the hills of central India and in the Western Ghats south to Karnataka.[22][23][24] It migrates to all parts of peninsular India and Sri Lanka in winter. Exhausted birds sometimes turn up in human settlements.[19] It is rare in the Thar Desert.</p>

        <h3>Ecology and behaviour</h3>
        <p>Indian pittas roost in trees. They feed on insects and other small invertebrates that they usually pick up from the ground or leaf litter. They have also been noted to take kitchen food scraps from the ground. They breed during the south-west monsoon from June to August, with peaks in June in central India, and in July in northern India. The nest is a globular structure with a circular opening on one side built on the ground or on low branches. It is made up of dry leaves and grasses. The clutch is four to five eggs which are very glossy white and spherical with spots and speckles of deep maroon or purple. Avian malaria parasites have been noted in the species. Five out of thirteen birds in an ectoparasite survey were found to have the tick, Haemaphysalis spinigera. Their seasonal movements associated with the rains have not been well studied.</p>
