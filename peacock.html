        <h1>Peacock</h1> <br>
        <p>The peacock, known for its vibrant plumage, is a large bird belonging to the pheasant family. Males, or peacocks, are renowned for their striking iridescent feathers, which they fan out in a spectacular display during courtship rituals. This impressive tail, or train, can reach up to six feet long and features eye-catching "eyespots." Peacocks are also known for their loud calls and are often associated with beauty and grace in various cultures. The female, called a peahen, has more muted colors, which help with camouflage. Peacocks primarily feed on seeds, fruits, insects, and small reptiles. In blue and green peacocks, the male has a 90-130-cm (35-50-inch) body and 150-cm (60-inch) train of tail feathers that are coloured a brilliant metallic green. This train is mainly formed of the bird's upper tail coverts, which are enormously elongated. Each feather is tipped with an iridescent eyespot that is ringed with blue and bronze. In courtship displays, the cock elevates his tail, which lies under the train, thus elevating the train and bringing it forward. At the climax of this display, the tail feathers are vibrated, giving the feathers of the train a shimmering appearance and making a rustling sound.</p>

        <p>The blue peacock's body feathers are mostly metallic blue-green. The green peacock, with a train much like that of the blue, has green and bronze body feathers. Hens of both species are green and brown and are almost as big as the male but lack the train and the head ornament. In the wild, both species live in open lowland forests, flocking by day and roosting high in trees at night. During the breeding season, the male forms a harem of two to five hens, each of which lays four to eight whitish eggs in a depression in the ground. The eggs are incubated by the peahen until they hatch some 28 days later. The chicks have all of their feathers when they emerge from their eggs and are capable of flight roughly one week after hatching. Most blue and green peafowl become sexually mature at age three. However, some male blue peafowl have been known to breed as early as age two.</p>

        <p>As an ornamental bird, the peacock is a staple resident of many of the worldâ€™s zoos and has long been famous throughout the Old World. Green peacocks in captivity must be kept apart from other fowl, though, because of their aggressive disposition. Blue peacocks, though native to warm humid climates, can survive northern winters. Green peacocks, however, cannot tolerate much cold.It is brightly coloured, with a predominantly blue fan-like crest of spatula-tipped wire-like feathers and is best known for the long train made up of elongated upper-tail covert feathers, which bear colourful eyespots. These stiff feathers are raised into a fan and quivered in a display during courtship. Despite the length and size of these covert feathers, the Indian peacock is still capable of flight. The peahen lacks the train, has a white face, iridescent green lower neck and dull brown plumage. The Indian peafowl lives mainly on the ground in open forest or on land under cultivation where it forages for berries and grains, and also prey on snakes, lizards and small rodents. Its loud calls make it easy to detect, and in forest areas often indicate the presence of a predator. It forages on the ground in small groups and usually escapes on foot through undergrowth and avoids flying, though it flies into tall trees to roost.</p>
