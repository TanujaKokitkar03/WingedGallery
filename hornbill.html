        <h1>Hornbill</h1> <br>
        <p>The great hornbill is a large bird with a very large bill, which bears a sizable, brightly colored, horny growth known as the casque. The body is mostly black with a white neck, wing coverts, and flight feathers. The first two neck vertebrae of the hornbills have been fused to support their large bill. Though its bill looks quite heavy, is actually very light; it is made up of thin-walled hollow cells. This species is the largest hornbill found on the Indian subcontinent. It is said that the wing beat of a great hornbill can be heard more than a half mile away! The greater hornbill is able to consume as many as 150 figs during one meal. Hornbills are famous for their nesting ritual. Once courtship and mating are over, the female finds a tree hollow and seals herself in with dung and pellets of mud. The male gathers the pellets from the forest floor and swallows them and later regurgitates small saliva-covered building materials. He then gives them to the female who stays inside the nest leaving a slit for a window big enough to receive food and materials. For the next 6-8 weeks the male feeds the female through this opening. She does not emerge until she has molted and grown fresh feathers and her young is also feathered. Some male hornbills are so exhausted after the nesting process that a few may die.</p>

        <p>The most prominent feature of the hornbill is the bright yellow and black casque on top of its massive bill. The casque appears U-shaped when viewed from the front, and the top is concave, with two ridges along the sides that form points in the front, hence the Latin species epithet bicornis (two-horned). The back of the casque is reddish in females, while the underside of the front and back of the casque is black in males.</p>
        
        <p>The casque is hollow and serves no known purpose, although it is thought to be the result of sexual selection. Male hornbills indulge in aerial casque butting, with birds striking each other in flight.[12] The male spreads the preen gland secretion, which is yellow, onto the primary feathers and bill to give them the bright yellow colour.[13] The commissure of the beak is black and has a serrated edge which becomes worn with age. The wing beats are heavy, and the sound produced by birds in flight can be heard from a distance. This sound has been likened to the puffing of a steam locomotive starting up. The flight involves stiff flaps followed by glides with the fingers splayed and upcurled.</p>

        <h3>Ecology and Conservation</h3><br>
        <p>The abundance of this species tends to be correlated with the density of large trees, required for nesting, and it is therefore most common in unlogged forest. Hornbills consume a large number of insects and small animals that are seen as pests, so its future is important for a healthy ecosystem. Population numbers for this species are rapidly declining in many areas of its range because of deforestation from logging. Due to their large size, these birds are also hunted for food, the pet trade, and for their beautiful casques. A casque can fetch up to $90 and a single tail feather $15 in northeast India.</p>
