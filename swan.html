                        Swan, largest waterfowl species of the subfamily Anserinae, family
                        Anatidae (order Anseriformes). Most swans are classified in the
                        genus Cygnus. Swans are gracefully long-necked, heavy-bodied,
                        big-footed birds that glide majestically when swimming and fly
                        with slow wingbeats and with necks outstretched. They migrate in
                        diagonal formation or V-formation at great heights, and no other
                        waterfowl moves as fast on the water or in the air. Swans feed by
                        dabbling (not diving) in shallows for aquatic plants. Swimming or
                        standing, the mute (C. olor) and black (C. atratus) swans often
                        tuck one foot over the back. Male swans, called cobs, and females,
                        called pens, look alike. Legend to the contrary, swans utter a
                        variety of sounds from the windpipe, which in some species is
                        looped within the breastbone (as in cranes); even the mute swan,
                        the least vocal species, often hisses, makes soft snoring sounds,
                        or grunts sharply. The Southern Hemisphere has the black swan
                        (Australia) and two pink-legged forms (South America): the
                        black-necked swan (C. melancoryphus), an especially bad-tempered
                        but beautiful bird, with white body, black neck and head, and
                        prominent red caruncle (fleshy outgrowth) on the bill; and the
                        coscoroba (Coscoroba coscoroba), an all-white bird that is usually
                        considered the smallest swan but may have affinities with the
                        whistling duck.

            Swans are sociable except in breeding season. They mate for life.
            Courtship involves mutual bill dipping or head-to-head posturing. The
            pen incubates, on average, a half-dozen pale unmarked eggs on a heap of
            vegetation while the cob keeps close guard; in some species he takes his
            turn at brooding. After repulsing an enemy, swans utter a triumph note,
            as geese do. The young, called cygnets, emerge short-necked and thickly
            downed; though capable of running and swimming a few hours after
            hatching, they are carefully tended for several months; in some species
            they may ride about on their mother’s back. Immature birds wear mottled
            gray or brown plumage for two or more years. Swans mature in the third
            or fourth year and live perhaps 20 years in the wild and 50 years or
            more in captivity. Of the seven or eight species—some of them probably
            races of a species, as indicated below by scientific names in
            parentheses—five are all-white, black-legged birds of the Northern
            Hemisphere: the mute swan, with a black knob at the base of its orange
            bill, curved posture of the neck, and aggressive wing arching; the
            trumpeter swan (C. cygnus buccinator), named for its far-carrying
            low-pitched call and having an all-black bill; the whooper swan (C.
            cygnus cygnus), a noisy bird with black bill having a conspicuous yellow
            base; the similar but smaller and quieter Bewick’s swan (C. columbianus
            bewickii), of which Jankowski’s swan (C. columbianus jankowskii) may be
            merely the eastern race; and the whistling swan (C. columbianus
            columbianus), named for its voice and having a black bill with, usually,
            a small yellow spot near the eye. Some ornithologists (especially in the
            United States) place the last four swans in the genus Olor, reserving
            Cygnus for the mute swan.

            Once threatened with extinction—fewer than 100 birds were counted in the
            United States in 1935—the trumpeter swan has made a strong comeback in
            the national parks of the western United States and Canada, but the
            total population in the mid-1970s was only about 2,000. It is the
            largest swan—about 1.7 metres (5.5 feet) long, with a 3-metre (10-foot)
            wingspan—but it weighs less than the mute swan, which at 23 kg (50
            pounds) is the heaviest flying bird. The Southern Hemisphere has the
            black swan (Australia) and two pink-legged forms (South America): the
            black-necked swan (C. melancoryphus), an especially bad-tempered but
            beautiful bird, with white body, black neck and head, and prominent red
            caruncle (fleshy outgrowth) on the bill; and the coscoroba (Coscoroba
            coscoroba), an all-white bird that is usually considered the smallest
            swan but may have affinities with the whistling duck.
